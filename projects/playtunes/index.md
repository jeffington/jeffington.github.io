# PlayTunes for Android

PlayTunes was a music player app for Android that I first built in 2010 using Java, Eclipse, and the Android UI toolkit. The direction of the app mirrors my relationship to digital music. When I first designed it, I wanted to use my new T-Mobile G1 Android phone like an iPod. Years later, my listening habits shifted to Spotify and streaming music. My use of PlayTunes faded and ultimately I decided to pull the app from the Play Store. I believe very strongly that if I'm unwilling or unable to support an app, that it should not be available to download. The source code for PlayTunes is publicly available on GitHub.
