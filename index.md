## About Me

Hi, I'm Jeff Meyerhoff and I'm a mobile application developer.

I've written mobile applications for iPhone and iPad in Objective-C, Android applications in Java, . For the last five years I've worked with Elite Electronic Engineering in Downers Grove, IL. Under the direction of Kevin Halpin, I re-used the data model from a Visual Basic.NET application to create a version for iPad called **preTOLD C-130J** (or just preTOLD) using Visual Studio for Mac and the Xamarin tools. 

And using the application PaintCode, I have successfully created custom user interface (UI) components. (Example TOLD Card.) One way that pilots and coordinators share flight information is through a TOLD (TOLD is short for Take Off and Landing)

The separate pieces of the TOLD card are all created in PaintCode. This gave us the flexibility to create the custom interaction of tapping and dismissing each section of the form, as well as switching the light/dark mode.

Using PaintCode also made it very straightforward to shareable PDFs.

|![C-130J preTOLD App Icon](/assets/images/projects/pretold/pretold-app-icon-96.png)|preTOLD is a flight planning application for pilots of the Lockheed Martin C-130J cargo airplane. C-130J preTOLD is the only TOLD planning tool approved by Lockheed Martin for technical accuracy and overall functionality. It takes the TOLD planning capability of the Mission Computer (MC TOLD) off the flight deck and into the hands of crew members and planners. C-130J preTOLD has been validated against MC TOLD in partnership with Lockheed Martin. For crew members, C-130J preTOLD adds pinpoint accuracy and confidence to preflight mission planning and enables operators to utilize the full capability of the C-130J every day.|
