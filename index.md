Hi, I'm Jeff Meyerhoff and I'm a mobile application developer.

I started working as a freelance software developer right out of college in 2010.

I enjoy working directly with clients, being flexible to their project needs, and .

While I enjoyed getting to use many tools and develop for many platforms over the years, I have relished working with Elite Electronic Engineering for the last four years and working within the same toolset all in that time.

I've enjoyed creating cross-platform data models in C# and .NET that can be used in applications on Windows, iOS, Android, and macOS. Remaining in a single programming language while working with different platform APIs has really accelerated my growth as a developer and given me a new appreciation for the similarities and differences of the major platforms.
