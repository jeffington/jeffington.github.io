Hi, I'm Jeff Meyerhoff and I'm a mobile application developer.

I've written mobile applications for iPhone and iPad in Objective-C, Android applications in Java, . For the last five years I've worked with Elite Electronic Engineering in Downers Grove, IL. Under the direction of Kevin Halpin, I re-used the data model from a Visual Basic.NET application to create a version for iPad called **preTOLD C-130J** (or just preTOLD) using Visual Studio for Mac and the Xamarin tools. 

And using the application PaintCode, I have successfully created custom user interface (UI) components. (Example TOLD Card.) One way that pilots and coordinators share flight information is through a TOLD (TOLD is short for Take Off and Landing)

The separate pieces of the TOLD card are all created in PaintCode. This gave us the flexibility to create the custom interaction of tapping and dismissing each section of the form, as well as switching the light/dark mode.

Using PaintCode also made it very straightforward to shareable PDFs.
